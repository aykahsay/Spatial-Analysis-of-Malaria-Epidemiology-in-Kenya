Spatial Analysis of Malaria Epidemiology in Kenya 🇰🇪🦟📌 Project OverviewThis project performs a spatial econometric analysis of malaria incidence across the 47 counties of Kenya. By integrating epidemiological, climatic, socio-economic, and demographic data, the study identifies statistically significant disease hotspots and models the drivers of transmission using Spatial Lag Models (SLM).The analysis moves beyond simple descriptive statistics to prove that malaria in Kenya is a spatially dependent phenomenon driven by environmental factors and cross-border spillover effects.🚀 Key ObjectivesVisualize the spatial distribution of malaria incidence using Choropleth maps.Detect global and local spatial clustering (Hotspots/Coldspots) using Moran's I and LISA.Model the drivers of transmission (Rainfall, Temperature, Poverty) while accounting for spatial dependence.📊 Data SourcesThe study integrates four distinct datasets:Spatial Boundaries: GADM (v4.1) - Kenya County Shapefiles.Epidemiology: Ministry of Health - Malaria incidence (cases per 1,000).Socio-Economic: KNBS (2022) - Overall Poverty Headcount Rates.Climate: Simulated annual Rainfall (mm) and Temperature (°C) based on ecological zones.Demographics: KNBS (2025 Proj.) - Population totals.🛠️ Methodology & R PackagesThe analysis is conducted entirely in R using the following key packages:sf: For handling spatial vector data (shapefiles).tmap: For generating static and interactive maps.spdep: For spatial weights matrices and autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I).spatialreg: For fitting Spatial Lag (SLM) and Spatial Error (SEM) models.tidyverse: For data cleaning and manipulation.📈 Key Findings1. Spatial ClusteringGlobal Moran's I: 0.35 ($p < 0.001$), indicating strong positive spatial autocorrelation.Hotspots (High-High): A massive contiguous cluster identified in the Lake Endemic Zone (Siaya, Kisumu, Busia, Kakamega, Homa Bay, Vihiga).Coldspots (Low-Low): Identified in the Central Highlands (Nyeri, Meru, Nyandarua) due to the "altitude shield" effect.2. Regression ModelingModel Selection: The Spatial Lag Model (SLM) outperformed OLS and SEM with the lowest AIC (475.67).Drivers:Rainfall: Statistically significant ($p=0.006$). Higher rainfall = Higher malaria.Spillover ($\rho$): Significant ($p=0.027$). Approx. 37% of infection risk is determined by neighbors.Poverty & Temp: Lost significance in the spatial model, overpowered by the force of transmission in high-burden areas.📂 Repository Structurespatial-malaria-kenya/
